Scope of this project is to analize the open source data of airbnb listings in the city of Berlin, compiled on the 21st December of 2022.

Notes:
- Some of the data files provided by insideairbnb.com containing the raw data exceed the file size limit of 100mb of github. Therefore the files are processed and stored in seperate files to keep them small enough.
