### Additional requirements <a name="installation"></a>

There are no specific requirements or installations necessary to compile and run the projectfiles. If you run the code with the standard Anaconda distribution and Python 3 there should be no errors.

### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For me, living in Berlin and interested in data, I was curios about some airbnb stats about my city. For my brief analysis I tackled the dataset, available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) (downloaded 01.03.2023), asking following questions:

1. Which neighborhoods are the most popular for tourists visiting Berlin?
2. Which neighborhoods are there most expensive to book an apartment and which are the more affordable ones?
3. Which neighborhood generates the most revenue over one year? (Calculated with the current booking data)

### Project(-file) Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The questions of interests are analyzed in three different notebooks, labeled accordingly. Additionally there is a notebook that runs code to generate a prediction model to predict the price of a listing. In all notebooks there are markdown cells used to comment on the code and explaining the thought process throughout the notebook.

### Results<a name="results"></a>
All findings and conclusions are listed and discussed in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@d.hutcheson/berlin-analyzing-airbnb-data-to-get-to-know-my-city-from-a-visitors-perspective-aa719d62fc4a). The code and all files necessary are available on my [Github](https://github.com/Daniel-Hutcheson/airbnb_berlin).

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
There is no licensing for the code in this repository, anyone can use it however they want. Following entities/authors I want to give credit for supplying the necessary data, a rough blueprint for this project and somehow inspiration:
- Inside Airbnb for supplying datasets on airbnb listings for several cities -> [Link](http://insideairbnb.com/)
- Josh Bernhard and his project analyzing a stackoverflow dataset -> [Github-Link](https://github.com/jjrunner/stackoverflow/blob/master/README.md?plain=1) & [Medium-Link](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711)
- Udacity and their Data Science Nanodegree, which supplied me with the necessary knowledge to tackle this task -> [Link](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025?utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=19167921312_c_individuals&utm_term=143524475679&utm_keyword=data%20science%20udacity_e&gclid=CjwKCAjw586hBhBrEiwAQYEnHUC0B8HfRUWGXeHeq4KpOgO_tAuoldZ4Fyop1A65Lt4elEGxNyXLhhoCuWoQAvD_BwE)
